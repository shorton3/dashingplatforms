# Quick Reference hints for running the gdb debugger
gdb -d /opt/ACE_wrappers/ace -d /opt/ACE_wrappers/TAO/tao -d /opt/ACE_wrappers/TAO/orbsvcs/orbsvcs -c core.5178 -se OPMTest
# then issue 'bt' to get the stack trace

# For shared library symbol debugging
nm <shared library file>

# To see the contents / file paths of an RPM:
rpm -qil <rpm name without .i686.rpm extension>

# To see the description text inside an RPM:
rpm -qip <package file name>

# To detect freeing memory twice:
Glibc has a method to force program termination on double deletes. Run the application with the MALLOC_CHECK_ variable set:export MALLOC_CHECK_=2. This will force an abort at the first instance of duplicate delete giving you a core with the
exact location of the bug.
