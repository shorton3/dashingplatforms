This 'messages' package directory is meant for classes that 1.) inherit from platform/msgmgr/MessageBase, and 2.) are used to be sent across nodes/processes. Messages that are sent through Distributed and Group Mailboxes shold certainly be implemented here; messages that are used with LocalSMMailboxes may or may not be located here (but probably need to be). Messages that are only used within a single process and used with LocalMailboxes only can be located in their respected application package directories.
