NOTE: Both Java's idlj and Tao's tao_idl compilers act/behave very differently. By default TAO puts the source files generated from the IDL in the current directory. However, because of Java's package structure features, the Java IDL compiler uses the module name inside the IDL and mapps that to a package directory name. For this reason, we must use the IDL_CPP_OUTPUT_DIR variable in the Makefile to put the TAO source files in a subdirectory that matches the module name (or whatever name). This means that all TAO/C++ IDL generated source files will go into the same directory; whereas the Java IDL compiler (idlj) will create a new package directory for each IDL/module name it finds (so, in other words, one single shared library for C++ stubs and skeletons, multiple jar files -- one for each module/idl).

The procedure for this Make directory is to initially 'make idl'. This will invoke both IDL compilers, generate, and overwrite source file stubs, skeletons, and skeleton implementation files. Because of this, you MUST move the implementation files into another Make directory so that your implementation does not get overwritten the next time that 'make idl' is called. Your implementation files should include the skeleton/stub headers and use the shared library files for linker resolution of those symbols. Anytime there are changes to the IDL, the implementation files should be re-generated and diff'ed with the ones that were modified in the other directory -- then, the modifications can be ported over.

Also, because there is no way to automatically 'know' what source files are going to be created by the IDL compiler, you MUST analyze the list of source files created each time 'make idl' is called and update the Package Directory Makefile with the updated list of SOURCE files. This will probably have to remain a manual step.

Also Note: The Tao IDL compiler produces different code depending on which version you use (Redhat3 or Redhat4). The IDL compiler has to be re-run when you switch between OS versions (and versions of ACE+TAO)
