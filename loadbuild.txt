Loadbuild Instructions:

#########
# Note about building ACE+TAO: switch to root, set environment from setEnv.sh,
# then: make debug=1 optimize=1 exceptions=1 threads=1
#########

1. Source the environment (you may need to change setEnv.sh to match your compiler version):
	. ./setEnv.sh

2. Build the platform libraries and binaries (Note: supply a buildtag with no spaces):
	cd dev/src/platform
	make BuildTag=030114_BuildTag
	make doxygen (optional for making source docs)
	make statistics (optional)

3. Compile the ems IDL stubs and skeletons using both Java and C++ IDL compilers:
   (Note: This must be re-performed whenever you switch between compilers/ACE+TAO versions
   since the code that gets generated inside the stubs/skeletons is different for each)
	cd dev/src/ems
	make idl

4. Build the ems libraries and binaries (Note: supply a buildtag with no spaces)
	cd dev/src/ems
	make BuildTag=030114_BuildTag
	make doxygen (optional for making source docs)
        make statistics (optional)

5. Build the unittest libraries and binaries (Note: supply a buildtag with no spaces)
	cd dev/src/unittest
	make BuildTag=030114_BuildTag
        make doxygen (optional for making source docs)
        make statistics (optional)

To rebuild from scratch (without incremental build), you must first make clean:
	cd dev/src/unittest
	make clean
	cd dev/src/ems
	make clean
	cd dev/src/platform
	make clean

In order to deploy the ProcessManager and child components for Linux start,
the following files must be in place:
	/etc/platformInit.conf
	/etc/init.d/platformInit (in DEV_ROOT/bin/platformInit.init.d)
	DEV_ROOT/bin/ProcessManager.conf
