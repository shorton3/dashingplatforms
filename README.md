# Dashing Platforms
Platform infrastructure middleware supports event dispatch and other basic services. 
## Features
1. Written in C++ using ACE-the Adaptive Communication Environment created by Doug Schmidt which supported by several university research groups.
2. Performance and footprint make it applicable for both embedded and non-embedded environments.
3. Message bus based communication using Mailboxes paradigm and supporting unicast, broadcast, and multicast message delivery.
4. Management interfaces uses TAO CORBA for C++ and Jacorb for Java.
5. Provides skeleton primitives for platform logger, relational database interface, object/memory pooling and re-use. 
## Documentation
1. See DashingPlatformsDevelopersHandbook in the root directory for complete documentation.
2. Additionally, docs/index.html is the link to the Javadocs API documentation
3. docs/html/index.html is the link to the doxygen API documentation for C++ components.
4. Unittest doxygen APIs can optionally be generated
## History
I created this as a side project with the intent of starting a company around delivering platform infrastructure software and services; however, it never took off. For several years, platform technology has been rapidly changing as the cloud has become the alternative solution for feature-focused companies who struggle to add a platform to their products. By my releasing this to the open source community, I hope that someone can find it useful and benefit by using it.
